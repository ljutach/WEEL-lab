               					Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
               					
               					Before I begin to
               					speak about my subject proper let me make a<br>
               					few introductory
               					remarks.
               
               					
               						I feel I shall have great difficulties in<br>
               					communicating my
               					thoughts to you and I think some of them may be<br>
               					diminished by mentioning
               					them to you beforehand.
               
               					The first one, which<br>
               					almost I need not mention, is, that English is not
               					my native tongue and<br>
               					my expression therefore often lacks that precision
               					and subtilty which<br>
               					would be desirable if one talks
               					about a difficult subject.
               
               					All I can do<br>
               					is to ask you to make my task easier by trying to get at my meaning<br>	
               					inspite of the faults which I will constantly be committing against the<br>
               					English grammar.
               
               					The second difficulty I will mention is this, that<br>
               					probably many of you
               					come up to this lecture of mine with slightly wrong<br>
               					expectations.
               
               					And to set you right in this point I will say a few<br>
               					words about the
               					reason for choosing the subject I have chosen: When<br>
               					your
               					former secretary honoured me by asking me to read a paper to your<br>
               					society, my first thought was that I would certainly do it and my second<br>
               					thought was that if I was to have the opportunity to speak to you I<br>
               					should speak about something which I am keen on communicating to you and<br>
               					that I should not misuse this opportunity to give you a lecture about,<br>
               					say, logic.
               
               					
               						I call this a misuse for to explain a scientific matter to<br>
               					you it
               					would need a course of lectures and not an hour's paper.
               
               					An<br>
               					other alternative would have been to give you what's called a
               					popular<br>
               					scientific lecture, that is a lecture intended to make you
               					believe that<br>
               					you understand a thing which actually you don't
               					understand, and to<br>
               					gratify what I believe to be one of the lowest desires
               					of modern people,<br>
               					namely the superficial curiosity about the latest
               					discoveries of science.<br>
               					
               					
               					
               					I rejected these alternatives and decided to talk to you about a
               					subject<br>
               					which seems to me to be of general importance, hoping that it may
               					help<br>
               					to clear up your thoughts about this subject (even if you
               					should<br>
               					2) entirely disagree with what I will say
               					about it).
               
               					My third and last<br>
               					difficulty is one which, in fact, adheres to most
               					lengthy philosophical<br>
               					lectures and it is this, that the hearer is
               					incapable of seeing both<br>
               					the road he is led and the goal which it leads
               					to.
               
               					That is to say: he<br>
               					either thinks: “I understand
               					all he says, but what on earth is he driving<br>
               					at” or else he
               					thinks “I see what he's driving at, but how on earth is<br>
               					he going to get there”.
               					
               
               					All I can do is again to ask you to be patient<br>
               					and to hope that in the
               					end you may see both the way and where it leads<br>
               					to. ‒ ‒ ‒

            <p class="paragraph">
               					
               						I will now begin.
               					
               							
               					My subject, as you know, is Ethics and I will<br>
               					adopt the
               					explanation of that term which <span class="name">Prof. Moore</span> has given in his<br>
               					book
               				“Principia Ethica”.
               					
               						
               					He says: “Ethics is the general enquiry into<br>
               					what is good”.
               					
               							
               					
               					Now I am going to use the term Ethics in a slightly<br>
               					wider sense,
               					in a sense in fact which includes what I believe to be the<br>
               					most essential
               					part of what is generally called Aesthetics.
               					
               							
               						
               					And to make<br>
               					you see as clearly as possible what I take to be the
               					subject matter of<br>
               						Ethics I will put before you a number of more or
               					less synonymous expres<br>
               					sions each of which could be substituted for
               					the above definition, and<br>
               					by enumerating them I want to produce the same
               					sort of effect which<br>
               					<span class="name">Galton
                  					</span> produced when he took a number of photos of
               					different faces<br>
               					on the same photographic plate in order to get the
               					picture of the<br>
               					typical features they all had in common.
               					
               							
               					
               					And as by showing to you such a<br>
               					collective photo I could make you see
               					what is the typical – say – <br>
               					
               					c
               					C
               					hinese face;
               					so if you look through the row of synonyms which I will put<br>
               					before you,
               					you will, I hope, be able to see the characteristic<br>
               					features they all
               					have in common and these are the characteristic<br>
               					features of
               					Ethics.
               					
               
               					Now instead of saying “E
               					
               					t
               					thics
               					is the enquiry into<br>
               					what is good” I could have said
               					Ethics is the enquiry into what is valu<br>
               					able, or, into what is
               					really important, or I could have said Ethics is<br>
               					
               					3) the enquiry into the meaning of life, or
               					into what makes life worth living,
               					<br>
               					or into the right way of
               					living.
               					
               
               					
               						I believe if you look at all these phrases<br>
               					you will get a rough
               					idea as to what it is that Ethics is concerned with.<br>
               					
               					 Now the first thing that strikes one about all these expressions is
               					that<br>
               					each of them is actually used in two very different senses.
               					
               
               					
               						I will call<br>
               					them the trivial or relative sense on the one hand
               					and the ethical or<br>
               					absolute sense on the other.
               					If for instance I say that this is a good
               					<br>
               					chair this means
               					that the chair serves a certain predetermined purpose and<br>
               					the word “good”
               					here has only meaning so far as this purpose has been pre<br>
               					viously
               					fixed upon.
               					
               
               					In fact the word 
               					“good”
               					 in the
               					relative sense simply<br>
               					means coming up to a certain predetermined
               					standard.
               					
               
               					Thus when we say that<br>
               					this man is a good pianist we mean that he can
               					play pieces of a certain<br>
               					degree of difficulty with a certain degree of
               					dexterity.
               					
               
               					And similarly if<br>
               					I say that it is important for me not to
               					catch cold I mean that catching<br>
               					a cold produces certain describable
               					disturbances in my life and if I say<br>
               					that this is the right
               					road that it I mean that it's the right road rela<br>
               					tive
               					to a certain goal.
               					
               
               					Used in this way these expressions don't present<br>
               					any difficult or
               					deep problems.
               					But this is not how Ethics uses them.<br>
               					
               
               					Supposing that I could play tennis and one of you saw me playing and
               					said<br>
               					“well you play pretty badly” and suppose I
               					answered “I know, I'm playing<br>
               					badly but I don't want
               					to play any better”, all the other man could say<br>
               					would be
               					“Ah then that's all right”.
               					
               
               					But suppose I had told one of you a<br>
               					preposterous lie and he came up to
               					me and said “You're behaving like a<br>
               					beast” and then I were to say “I know I behave
               					badly, but then I don't<br>
               					want to behave any better”, could
               					he then say “Ah, then that's all
               					right”?
               					
               
               					<br>
               					Certainly not; he would say “Well, you ought
               					to want to behave better”.
               					
               					<br>
               					Here you have an absolute judgment of value, whereas the first instance<br>
               					was one of a relative judgment.
               					
               
               					The essence of this difference seems to<br>
               					be obviously this:
               					Every judgment of relative value is a mere statement of<br>
               					
               					4) facts and can therefore be put in such a
               					form that it loses all the<br>
               					appearance of a judgment of value:
               					Instead of saying “this is the right way<br>
               					to
               					<span class="name">Granchester</span>
               					”
               					 I could equally well have
               					said “this is the right way you<br>
               					have to go if you want to get
               					to <span class="name">Granchester</span> in the shortest time”,
               					
               					“this<br>
               					man is a good runner”
               					
               					simply means that he runs a certain number of miles in<br>
               					a certain number
               					of minutes, a.s.f.
               					
               					
               					Now what I wish to contend is, that<br>
               					although all judgments of relative
               					value can be shown to be mere statements<br>
               					of facts, no statement of fact
               					can ever be, or imply, a judgment of<br>
               					absolute value.
               
               					Let me explain this: Suppose one of you were an omniscient<br>
               					person and therefore knew all the movements of all the bodies in the
               					world<br>
               					dead or alive and that he also knew all the states of mind of all
               					human<br>
               					beings that ever lived, and suppose this man wrote all he knew in a
               					big<br>
               					book, then this book would contain the whole description of the
               					world; and<br>
               					what I want to say is, that this book would contain nothing
               					that we would<br>
               					call an ethical judgment or anything that would
               					logically imply such a<br>
               					judgment.
               					
               
               					It would of course contain all relative judgments of value and<br>
               					all true
               					scientific propositions and in fact all true propositions that can<br>
               					be
               					made.
               					
               
               					But all the facts described would, as it were, stand on the same<br>
               					level
               					and in the same way all propositions stand on the same level.
               					
               
               					There<br>
               					are no propositions which, in any absolute sense, are sublime,
               					important,<br>
               					or trivial.
               					
               					Now perhaps some of you will agree to that and be reminded of<br>
               					Hamlet's words: 
               					“Nothing is either
               					good or bad, but thinking makes it so”.
               					
               						
               					<br>
               					But this again could lead to a misunderstanding.
               					What Hamlet
               					says seems to<br>
               					imply that good and bad, though not qualities of the world
               					outside us, are<br>
               					attributes of our states of mind.
               					But what I mean is that a state of mind,<br>
               					so far as we mean by that a
               					fact which we can describe, is in no ethical<br>
               					sense good or bad.
               					
               					
               
               					If for instance in our world-book we read the descrip<br>
               					tion of a
               					murder with all its details physical and psychological the mere<br>
               					description of these facts will contain nothing which we could call an<br>
               					
               					5)
               					ethical proposition.
               					
               
               					The murder will be on exactly the same level as any<br>
               					other event, for
               					instance the falling of a stone.
               					
               
               					Certainly the reading of<br>
               					this description might cause us pain or rage
               					or any other emotion, or we<br>
               					might read about the pain or rage caused by
               					this murder in other people<br>
               					when they heard of it, but there will simply
               					be facts, facts and facts but<br>
               					no Ethics. –
               					
               
               					And now I must say that if I contemplate what Ethics really<br>
               					would
               					have to be if there were such a science, this result seems to me<br>
               					quite
               					obvious.
               					
               
               					It seems to me obvious that nothing we could ever think or<br>
               					say should
               					be the thing.
               					
               
               					That we cannot write a scientific book, the sub<br>
               					ject matter of which
               					could be intrinsically sublime and above all other<br>
               					subject
               					matters.
               					
               
               					
               						I can only describe my feeling by the metaphor, that, if<br>
               					a man
               					could write a book on Ethics which really was a book on Ethics,
               					this<br>
               					book would, with an explosion, destroy all the other books in the
               					world. – <br>
               					
               
               					Our words used as we use them in science, are vessels capable only of
               					con<br>
               					taining and conveying meaning and sense, natural meaning
               					and sense.

               					Ethics, if it is anything, is supernatural and our words will only

               					I said that so far
               					as facts and
               					propositions<br>
               					are concerned there is only relative value and

               					<br>
               					And let me, before I go on, illustrate this by a rather
               					obvious example.<br>
               					
               
               					The right road is the road which leads to an arbitrarily predetermined
               					end<br>
               					and it is quite clear to us all that there is no sense in talking
               					about the<br>
               					right road apart from such a predetermined goal.
               					
               
               					Now let us see what we<br>
               					could possibly mean by the expression
               				“the absolutely right road”.
               					
               
               					
               					I think<br>
               					it would be the road which everybody on seeing
               					it would, with logical<br>
               					necessity have to go, or be ashamed for
               					not going.
               					
               
               					And similarly the<br>
               					absolute
               					good, if it is a
               					describable state of affairs would be one which<br>
               					everybody, independent of
               					his tastes and inclinations, would necessarily
               					<br>
               					bring about or
               					feel guilty for not bringing about.
               					
               
               					And I want to say that<br>
               					such a state of affairs is a chimera.
               					
               
               					No state of affairs has in itself,<br>
               					
               					6) what I would like to call, the coercive
               					power of an absolute judge. –
               					
               					<br>
               
               					Then what have all of us who, like myself, are still tempted to use
               					such<br>
               					expressions as “absolute good”,
               					“absolute value”
               					etc.
               					,
               					what have we in mind<br>
               					and what do we try to express?
               					
               
               					Now whenever I try to make this clear to<br>
               					myself it is natural that I
               					should recall cases in which I would certainly<br>
               					use these expressions and
               					I am then in the situation and in which you would<br>
               					be if, for instance, I
               					were to give you a lecture on the psychology of<br>
               					pleasure.
               					
               
               					What you would do then would be to try and recall some typical<br>
               					situation in which you always felt pleasure.
               					
               
               					For, bearing this situation in<br>
               					mind, all I should say to you would
               					become concrete and, as it were,<br>
               					controllable.
               					
               
               					One man would perhaps choose as his stock example the sensa<br>
               					tion
               					when taking a walk on a fine summer's day.
               					
               
               					Now in this situation I am<br>
               					if I want to fix my mind on what I mean by
               					absolute or ethical value.<br>
               					
               
               					And there, in my case, it always happens that the idea of one
               					particular<br>
               					experience presents itself to me which therefore is, in a
               					sense, my ex<br>
               					perience 
               					
               					for
               					 par
               					 excellence and
               					this is the reason why, in talking to you now,<br>
               					I will use this experience
               					as my first and foremost example.
               					
               
               					(As I have<br>
               					said before, this is an entirely personal matter and
               					others would find<br>
               					other examples more striking.)
               					
               
               					
               						I will describe this experience in order, if<br>
               					possible, to make
               					you recall the same or similar experiences, so that we<br>
               					may have a common
               					ground for our investigation.
               					
               
               					
               					I believe the best way of<br>
               					describing it is to say that when I
               					have it I wonder at the existence of<br>
               					the world.
               					
               
               					And I am then inclined to use such phrases as “how
               					extraordi<br>
               					nary that anything should exist” or
               					“how extraordinary that the world<br>
               					should
               					exist”.
               					
               
               					
               					
               					I will mention another experience straight away which I also<br>
               					know
               					and which others of you might be acquainted with: it is, what one<br>
               					might call, the experience of feeling absolutely safe.
               					
               						
               					
               					I mean the state of<br>
               					mind in which one is inclined to say
               					“I am safe, nothing can injure me<br>
               					whatever
               					happens”.
               					
               					
               
               					Now let me consider these experiences, for, I believe,<br>
               					they exhibit the
               					very characteristics we try to get clear about.
               					
               
               					And there<br>
               					
               					7) the first thing I have to say is, that
               					the verbal expression which we give<br>
               					to these experiences is
               					nonsense!
               					
               
               					If I say “I wonder at the existence of<br>
               					the
               					world”
               					 I am misusing language.
               					
               
               					Let me explain this: It has a perfectly<br>
               					good and clear
               					sense to say that I wonder at something being the case, we<br>
               					all understand
               					what it means to say that I wonder at the size of a dog which<br>
               					is bigger
               					than anyone I have ever seen before or at any thing which, in the<br>
               					common
               					sense of the word, is extraordinary.
               					
               
               					In every such case I wonder at<br>
               					something being the case which I
               					could conceive not to be the case.
               					
               
               					
               					I wonder<br>
               					at the size of this dog because I could conceive of a
               					dog of another, namely<br>
               					the ordinary size, at which I should not
               					wonder.
               					
               
               					To say “I wonder at such and<br>
               					such being the
               					case”
               					 has only sense if I can imagine it not to be
               					the case.<br>
               					
               
               					In this sense one can wonder at the existence of, say, a house when one
               					sees<br>
               					it and has not visited it for a long time and has imagined that it
               					had been<br>
               					pulled down in the meantime.
               					
               
               					But it is nonsense to say that I wonder at the<br>
               					existence of the world,
               					because I cannot imagine it not existing.
               					
               
               					
               					I could of<br>
               					course wonder at the world round me being as it
               					is.
               					
               
               					If for instance I had this<br>
               					experience while looking into the blue sky,
               					I could wonder at the sky being<br>
               					blue as opposed to the case when it's
               					clouded.
               					But that's not what I mean.<br>
               					
               
               					
               					I am wondering at the sky being whatever it is.
               					
               
               					One might be tempted to say<br>
               					that what I am wondering at is a
               					t
               					
               					
               					
               					
               					autology, namely at the sky being
               					blue or<br>
               					not blue.
               					
               
               					But then it's just nonsense to say that one is wondering at a<br>
               					ton
               					autology.
               					
               
               					Now the same applies to the other experience which I have
               					men<br>
               					tioned, the experience of absolute safety.
               					
               
               					We all know what it means in ordi<br>
               					nary life to be safe.
               					
               
               					
               					I am safe in my room, when I cannot be run over by an<br>
               					omnibus.
               					
               
               					
               					I am safe when I if I have had whooping cough and cannot
               					therefore<br>
               					get it again.
               					
               
               					To be safe essentially means that it is physically impossible
               					that<br>
               					certain things should happen to me and therefore it's nonsense
               					to say that<br>
               					I am safe whatever happens.
               					
               
               					Again this is a misuse of the word “safe” as
               					the<br>
               					other example was a misuse of the word
               					“existence” or
               					“wondering”.
               					
               
               					Now I want<br>
               					to impress on you that a certain characteristic misuse of
               					our language runs<br>
               					
               					8) through all ethical and
               					religious expressions.
               					
               
               					All these expressions seem,<br>
               					prima facie, to be just
               					similes.
               					
               
               					Thus it seems that when we are using the<br>
               					word right in an
               					ethical sense, although, what we mean, is not right in its<br>
               					trivial sense,
               					it's something similar, and when we say “this is a good<br>
               					fellow”, although the word
               				
               					“good”
               					 here doesn't mean
               					what it means in the sen<br>
               					tence “this is a good football
               		player” there seems to be some similarity.<br>
               					
               
               					And when we say “this man's life was valuable”
               					we don't mean it in the same<br>
               					sense in which we would speak of some
               					valuable jewelry but there seems to<br>
               					be some sort of analogy.
               					
               
               					Now all religious terms seem in this sense to be<br>
               					used as similes or
               					allegorically.
               					
               
               					For when we speak of God and that he
               					sees<br>
               					everything and when we kneel and pray to him all our terms and
               					actions<br>
               					seem to be parts of a great and elaborate allegory which
               					represents him as<br>
               					a human being of great power whose grace we try to win
               					etc.
               					etc.
               					
               
               					But this<br>
               					allegory also describes the experience which I have just
               					referred to.
               					
               
               					For,<br>
               					the first of them is, I believe, exactly what people were
               					referring to when<br>
               					they said that God had
               					created the world; and the experience of absolute<br>
               					safety has been
               					described by saying that we feel safe in the hands of God.<br>
               					
               					
               					A third experience of the same kind is that of feeling guilty and again<br>
               					this was described by the phrase that God
               					disapproves of our conduct.
               					
               
               					Thus<br>
               					in ethical and religious language we seem constantly to be using
               					similes.<br>
               					
               
               					But a simile must be the simile for something.
               					
               
               					And if I can describe a fact<br>
               					by means of a simile I must also be able
               					to drop the simile and to<br>
               					describe the facts without it.
               					
               
               					Now in our case as soon as we try to drop<br>
               					the simile and simply to
               					state the facts which stand behind it, we find,<br>
               					that there are no such
               					facts.
               					
               
               					And so, what at first appeared to be a 
               					<br>
               					simile, now
               					seems to be mere nonsense. –

            <p class="paragraph">
               					Now the three experiences which<br>
               					I have mentioned to you (and I could
               					have added others) seem to those who<br>
               					have experienced them, for
               					instance to me, to have in some sense an<br>
               					intrinsic, absolute
               					value.
               					
               
               					But when I say they are experiences, surely,<br>
               					they are facts; they have
               					taken place then and there, lasted a certain<br>
               					
               					9) definite time and consequently are
               					describable.
               					
               
               					And so from what I have<br>
               					said some minutes ago I must admit it is
               					nonsense to say that they have<br>
               					absolute value.
               					
               
               					And here I have arrived at the main point of this paper:<br>
               					it is the paradox that an experience, a fact should seem to have absolute value.
               					<br>
               					
               					And I will make my point still more acute by saying “it is<br>
               					the paradox that an experience, a fact, should seem to have supernatural<br>
               					value”
               					.
               					
               
               					Now there is a way in which I would be tempted to meet this
               					paradox.<br>
               					
               
               					Let me first consider, again, our first experience of wondering at the<br>
               					existence of the world and let me describe it in a slightly different
               					way
               					<br>
               					We all know what in ordinary life would be
               					called a miracle.
               					
               					It obviously<br>
               					is simply an event the like of which we never have
               					seen.
               					
               					<br>
               
               					Now suppose such an event happened.
               					<br>Take the case that one of you suddenly
               					grew a lion's head
               					and began to roar.
               					
               					<br>
               					Certainly that would be as extraordinary a thing as I can
               					imagine.
               					
               					<br>
               					
               					Now whenever we should have recovered from<br>
               					our surprise, what I would
               					suggest would be to fetch a doctor and have the<br>
               					case scientifically
               					investigated and if it were not for hurting him I would<br>
               					have him
               					vivisected.
               					
               
               					And where would the miracle have got to?
               					For it is<br>
               					clear that when we look at it in this way everything
               					miraculous has dis<br>
               					appeared; unless what we mean by this term is
               					merely that a fact has not<br>
               					yet been explained by science which again
               					means that we have hitherto<br>
               					failed to group this fact with others in a
               					scientific system.
               					
               
               					This shows<br>
               					that it is absurd to say “science has proved
               					that there are no miracles”.
               					
               					<br>
               
               					The truth is that the scientific way of looking at a fact is not the
               					way<br>
               					to look at it as a miracle.
               					
               
               					For imagine whatever fact you may, it is not in<br>
               					itself miraculous in
               					the absolute sense of that term.
               					
               
               					For we see now that<br>
               					we have been using the word
               					“miracle” in a relative and an absolute
               					sense.<br>
               					
               
               					And I will now describe the experience of wondering at the existence of
               					the<br>
               					world by saying: it is the experience of seeing the world as a
               					miracle.<br>
               					
               
               					Now I am tempted to say that the right expression in language for the<br>
               					miracle of the existence of the world, though it is not any proposition
               					in
               					<br>
               					language, is the existence of language itself.
               					
               
               					But what then does it mean<br>
               					
               					10) to be aware of this miracle at some
               					times and not at other times
               					.
               					?
               					
               					
               
               					For all<br>
               					I have said by shifting the expression of the miraculous from
               					an expression<br>
               					by means of language to the expression by
               					the existence of language, all I<br>
               					have said is again that we cannot
               					express what we want to express and that<br>
               					all we say about the
               					absolute miraculous remains nonsense. –
               					
               
               					Now the answer<br>
               					to all this will seem perfectly clear to many of
               					you.
               					
               
               					You will say: Well,<br>
               					if certain experiences constantly tempt
               					us to attribute a quality to them<br>
               					which we call absolute or ethical value
               					and importance, this simply shows<br>
               					that by these words we
               					don't mean nonsense, that after all what we mean by<br>
               					saying
               					that an experience has absolute value is just a fact like other<br>
               					facts and that all it comes to is that we have not yet succeeded in
               					finding<br>
               					the correct logical analysis of what we mean by our ethical and
               					religious<br>
               					expressions. –
               					
               
               					Now when this is urged against me I at once see clearly,<br>
               					as it were in
               					a flash of light, not only that no description that I can<br>
               					think of would
               					do to describe what I mean by absolute value, but that I<br>
               					would reject
               					every significant description that anybody could possibly<br>
               					suggest,
               					
               					ab initio
               					, on the ground of its significance.
               					
               
               					That is to say: I see<br>
               					now that these nonsensical expressions were
               					not nonsensical because I had<br>
               					not yet found the correct expressions, but
               					that their nonsensicality was<br>
               					their very essence.
               					
               
               					For all I wanted to do with them was just to go beyond
               					<br>
               					the
               					world and that is to say beyond significant language.
               					
               
               					My whole tendency<br>
               					and I believe the tendency of all men who ever tried
               					to write or talk<br>
               					Ethics or Religion was to run against the
               					boundaries of language.
               					
               
               					This<br>
               					running against the walls of our cage is perfectly, absolutely

               					What it says does not add to our knowledge in any sense.
               
               					But it<br>
               					is a document of a tendency in the human mind which I personally

               					respecting deeply and I would not for my life ridicule
               					it.
