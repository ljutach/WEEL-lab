                  						<span class="capital">I</span> feel I shall have great difficulties in<br>
                  					communicating my
                  					thoughts to you and I think some of them may be<br>

               <p class="sentence">The first one, which<br>
                  					almost I need not mention, is, that English is not
                  					my native tongue and<br>
                  					my expression therefore often lacks that precision
                  					and subtilty which<br>
                  					would be desirable if one talks
                  					about a difficult subject.</p>
               
               					
               <p class="sentence">All I can do<br>

                  					English grammar.</p>
               
               					
               <p class="sentence">The second difficulty I will mention is this, that<br>

                  					reason for choosing the subject I have chosen: <span class="capital">W</span>hen<br>
                  					your
                  					former secretary honoured me by asking me to read a paper to your<br>
                  					society, my first thought was that I would certainly do it and my second<br>
                  					thought was that if I was to have the opportunity to speak to you I<br>
                  					should speak about something which I am keen on communicating to you and<br>
                  					that I should not misuse this opportunity to give you a lecture about,<br>
                  					say, logic.</p>
               
               					
               <p class="sentence">

                  					you it
                  					would need a course of lectures and not an hour's paper.</p>
               
               					
               <p class="sentence">An<br>
                  					other alternative would have been to give you what's called a
                  					popular<br>
                  					scientific lecture, that is a lecture intended to make you
                  					believe that<br>
                  					you understand a thing which actually you don't
                  					understand, and to<br>
                  					gratify what I believe to be one of the lowest desires
                  					of modern people,<br>
                  					namely the superficial curiosity about the latest
                  					discoveries of science.<br>

                  					<span class="capital">I</span> rejected these alternatives and decided to talk to you about a
                  					subject<br>

                  					help<br>
                  					to clear up your thoughts about this subject (even if you
                  					should<br>
                  					2) entirely disagree with what I will say

               <p class="sentence">My third and last<br>
                  					difficulty is one which, in fact, adheres to most
                  					lengthy philosophical<br>
                  					lectures and it is this, that the hearer is
                  					incapable of seeing both<br>
                  					the road he is led and the goal which it leads
                  					to.</p>
               
               					
               <p class="sentence">That is to say: he<br>
                  					either thinks: “I understand
                  					all he says, but what on earth is he driving<br>
                  					at” or else he
                  					thinks “I see what he's driving at, but how on earth is<br>

                  					and to hope that in the
                  					end you may see both the way and where it leads<br>
